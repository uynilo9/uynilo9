            Just a normal 15 boy from ROC aka Taiwan. I enjoy programming, watching animes, and playing video games. I always start developing some interesting but tiny programs when there's nothing to do (lmao). I hope one day I could become a Full-stack Programmer (but professional) / Gaming Streamer / Physics Enthusiast (sounds like joking but I'm kinda serious).
