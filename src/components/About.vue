            Just a normal 15 boy from ROC/Taiwan. I enjoy programming, watching animes, and playing video games. I'll start developing some interesting but tiny programs when there's nothing to do (lmao). I hope one day I could become a Full-stack Programmer (but professional) / Gaming Streamer / Physics Enthusiast (sounds like joking). DM me on Discord if you wanna be friends with me :D
